# Linux-CLI-Intro

## An introduction to the Linux command line.

In the past I have provided some training on the basics of using the Linux command line to friends and colleagues. I thought that it would be a good idea to share some of the notes I made so others can benefit of it.

Although it might seem complicated at the beginning, the basic set of commands isn't extensive. It is all about building the knowledge in a logical way, with the previous lessons helping you understand the new ones.

That, and practice. Using the commands often will help you cement the knowledge and build your confidence.

I have focused on the commands that you are most likely going to use 90% of the time you are working with any system. \(No scientific argument for the 90% value, but I hope you understand my point.\) :\)

I believe that a good foundation will provide you with the building blocks to move towards more complex material, and additional self-learning.

I am uploading things as time allows, but even if you see no activity for long, I plan to complete this eventually.

I dabbed with the idea of using Latex, but that stopped me from focusing on the material. I might revisit the idea once the book is completed. For the time being Markdown is the format I am using for editing. Alternative formats might become available later on.

## NOTICE

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.** Updates are done frequently and new material is added as often as possible. There are going to be spelling mistakes, editing work and other changes before all the course parts are completed. Currently the focus is on adding all the material before editing and correcting.

This notice will remain until the course is complete.

Any and all feedback is appreciated.
