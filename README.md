# Linux-CLI-intro
An introduction to the Linux command line.
==========================================
I have provided some basic training on the use of Linux in the past, focusing on the commands that you have to use 90% of the time you are working with a system on a daily basis. This could be looking after your own system or a customer's.

I believe that a good foundation will provide you with the building blocks to move towards more complex material.

I am uploading things bit by bit as I am also only starting to get used to GitHub.

Currently only in markdown format, but once the course is more fleshed out and the text finalised I will offer it in alternative formats.
