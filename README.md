# Linux-CLI-intro
An introduction to the Linux command line.

I have provided some basic training on the use of Linux in the past focusing on the commands that you have to use 90% of the time you are working with a system.

This could be looking after your own system or a customer's.

FLOSS has been good to me and I would like to give something back to the community.

I will uploading things bit by bit as I am also only starting to get used to GitHub.
