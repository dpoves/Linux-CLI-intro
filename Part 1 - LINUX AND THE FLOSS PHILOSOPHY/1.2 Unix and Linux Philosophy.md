# 1.2 - Unix/Linux Philosophy

## The Unix philosophy
This is a summary from the Wikipedia's entry on Unix Philosophy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

The Unix is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development.

Early Unix developers brought the concepts of modularity and re-usability into software engineering practice. Over time, the leading developers of Unix and associated programs established a set of cultural norms for developing software. These norms have been termed the "Unix philosophy."

It emphasises building **simple**, **short**, **clear**, **modular**, and **extensible** code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators.

In essence, Unix development is:

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

The Unix philosophy favours composability. This is a system design principle that ensures that system components can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.

The essential features that make a component composable are that it be:

* **self-contained** (or **modular**)
It can be deployed independently â€“ note that it may cooperate with other components, but dependent components are replaceable
 
* **stateless**
It treats each request as an independent transaction, unrelated to any previous request.

On composable systems it is easier to evaluate their individual parts adding to their trustworthiness.
